# Contributing to PIVOTHEAD

We welcome and appreciate your contribution to Pivothead. These guidelines will help ensure a smooth and collaborative process for everyone.

## How Can You Contribute?

Here are some ways you can contribute to the project:

- Reporting bugs or issues
- Submitting feature requests
- Writing or improving documentation
- Fixing bugs
- Implementing new features

## Steps for Contributing

1. **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone** the forked repository to your local machine.

3. Create a new **branch** for your change: `git checkout -b <type>/<issue-id>-<description>`. See [branching guidelines](#branching-strategy) below.

4. **Make changes** and **test** to ensure they work as expected.

5. **Commit** your changes following our [commit message format](#commit-message-format): `git commit -m 'type(scope): subject'`

6. **Push** your branch to your GitHub repository: `git push origin <type>/<issue-id>-<description>`.

7. Create a **Pull Request** from your branch to the original repository's `dev`

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Types

- **main**: Production-ready code.
- **dev**: Integration branch for features and bug fixes.
- **feature/\***: New features.
- **bug/\***: Bug fixes.
- **hotfix/\***: Critical fixes.
- **fixes/\***: General fixes that do not need to be immediately addressed.
- **docs/\***: Documentation-related changes (e.g., README updates, new docs).
- **other/\***: For any other changes that do not fall into the above categories.
- **enhancement/\***: Improvements that are not categorized as features or bug fixes.
- **patch/\***: General maintenance tasks that don't fit into feature or bug fix categories.

### Branching Guidelines

- Always create a new branch from the **dev** branch.
- When raising a pull request (PR), it should always be merged into the **dev** branch.

### Naming Convention

Branches should follow the format:

- Format: `<type>/<issue-id>-<description>`
- Example: `feature/12345-add-login-button`

### Merge Strategy

- Use pull requests for all merges.
- Code must be reviewed and approved before merging to `main` or `dev`.

### Conflict Resolution

1. Pull the latest changes from the base branch.
2. Resolve conflicts locally.
3. Rebase the branch and push changes.

## Commit Message Format

We follow a conventional commit message format to ensure consistent and meaningful messages. This format helps in automated versioning, changelog generation, and release management in our monorepo structure.

### Commit Structure

```
type(scope): subject
```

- **type**: The type of change being made (see types below)
- **scope**: The package name from the monorepo being affected (required)
- **subject**: A brief description of the change

### Commit Types and Release Impact

- **feat**: A new feature or significant change (triggers MINOR version bump)

  - Example: `feat(react): add new drag-and-drop functionality`

- **fix**: A bug fix or issue resolution (triggers PATCH version bump)

  - Example: `fix(core): resolve element positioning bug`

- **docs**: Documentation changes only (no version bump)

  - Example: `docs(web-component): update API documentation`

- **chore**: Routine tasks, maintenance, or tooling changes (no version bump)

  - Example: `chore(react): update dev dependencies`

- **style**: Code style/formatting changes (no version bump)

  - Example: `style(core): format according to new eslint rules`

- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature (no version bump)

  - Example: `refactor(web-component): improve rendering performance`

- **test**: Adding or modifying tests (no version bump)

  - Example: `test(react): add unit tests for form component`

- **perf**: Performance improvements (triggers PATCH version bump)

  - Example: `perf(core): optimize rendering logic`

- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration (no version bump)
  - Example: `ci(web-component): update GitHub Actions workflow`

### Scopes

Scopes must match your package names in the monorepo:

- `core`: Core package changes
- `react`: React package changes
- `web-component`: Web Components package changes

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body and append a `!` after the type/scope:

```
feat(core)!: change API interface

BREAKING CHANGE: The API interface has changed. Users need to update their implementations.
```

Breaking changes will trigger a MAJOR version bump.

### Release Management

Commit messages directly influence our automated release process:

1. MAJOR version (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

   - Any commit with a breaking change (`!` or `BREAKING CHANGE` in body)

2. MINOR version (1.1.0 → 1.2.0)

   - Commits with `feat` type

3. PATCH version (1.1.1 → 1.1.2)

   - Commits with `fix` or `perf` type

4. No version change
   - Commits with `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, or `ci` types

## Setting up Husky for Git Hooks

Husky is used for running pre-commit checks and enforcing commit message conventions. Follow these steps to set up Husky in the project:

1. Install Husky: After cloning the repository, install the project dependencies by running: `pnpm install`

2. Enable Husky Hooks:
   Once dependencies are installed, enable Git hooks with Husky: `pnpm husky install`

3. Verify Husky Setup:
   After Husky is installed, you can test the hooks by making a commit. For more information, refer to [husky documentation](https://typicode.github.io/husky/get-started.html).

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Make sure your PR addresses an issue or feature request.
- Describe your PR and provide context in the description.
- Keep your PR focused on a single change to make reviewing easier.
- Ensure your code follows the project's coding style and conventions.
