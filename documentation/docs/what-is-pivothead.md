## Overview

PivotHead helps you transform raw data into structured, analyzable information through pivot tables - a data summarization tool that helps aggregate, sort, count, and average data stored in one table and display the results in a second table showing the summarized data.

With PivotHead, you can:

- **Analyze Data From Multiple Angles**: Reorganize and summarize selected columns and rows of data
- **Create Custom Calculations**: Apply formulas and functions to your data
- **Visualize Patterns and Trends**: Identify relationships that would otherwise be difficult to see
- **Make Data-Driven Decisions**: Generate insights from complex datasets quickly

## Key Features

PivotHead comes packed with features designed to handle complex data visualization needs:
